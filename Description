Book Recommendation system
Dataset url: http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/
Recommendations based on correlations
We use Pearsonsâ€™R correlation coefficient to measure the linear correlation between two variables, in our case, the ratings for two books.

First, we need to find out the average rating, and the number of ratings each book received.
Observations: In this data set, the book that received the most rating counts was not highly rated at all. As a result, if we were to use recommendations based on rating counts, we would definitely make mistakes here. So, we need to have a better system.

To ensure statistical significance, users with less than 200 ratings, and books with less than 100 ratings are excluded.
